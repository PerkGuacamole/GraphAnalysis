	Abdullah Al Raqibul Islam, Dong Dai:
	Understand the overheads of storage data structures on persistent memory. PPoPP 2020: 435-436
	Look at references and check them out to learn more about persistent memory

	Using the VPN allows access to papers from IEEE, and other websites

	write optimized data structures: b-epsilon trees. Michael Bender, Martin Farach-Colton

	Baseline: 
		 Naive Approach: Use persistent memory as read only and dram as writeable memory. This might be okay for certain algorithms that write as much. 
		
	Multithreaded page rank Page Rank
	
	Betweenness and Closeness: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6406265
		See if there is improvement on the storgae component of this
		(Computing betweenness centrality in external memory) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6691597
	
	Maybe do Sparse x Sparse matrix mulitplication (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/spgemm_sisc12.pdf)
		Authors are very good at this type of problem

	I was having trouble with SHH'ing into the persistent memory machine
	
	Installl the libraries on Windows 10 and test the compiler.
	Do the same for Linux
	
	Ask Dong and Raqibul how they build and if they use the Intel libraries pmemobj
	
	Continue to read the papers from last week
	
10/29/2020
	Run tests on the machine to make sure that persistent memory is being used
		Maybe reproduce the experiemnt from the papaer to ensure we are using persistent memroy 
	Use undirected graphs for ease.
	Store by row: http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node91.html

	Do not use short path algorithms
	Algorithms to try:
		https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310821013_Enterprise_breadth-first_graph_traversal_on_GPUs
	Read: Direction Optimizing for BFS
	Work on the memory benchmark
	Search if the OS might be caching PMEM data in DRAM
	We can check swap ( free command )
	
11/23/2020
	Get addtionally time on the machine
	Read the papers
	Code more benchmark
	The goal is ultimately to benchmark as much as we can
	Maybe get a paper into a workshop ( deadline in January )
