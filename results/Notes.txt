    Ran tests for page rank with explicit vectorization on neighbors versus v2, where the compiler vectoizes on page rank matrix.
    Seems that mine is faster for lower number of page ranks, and the compiler's version is better for higher number of page ranks.
    Action:
    	Use the compiler version
    	Also switching from static to dynamic scheduling

    Page Rank Results:
        I looked at the results for running page rank with the compiler.
        The results for lower page ranks performed worse than my implementation.
        My implementation, might actually have been better for DRAM, but worse for PMEM.
        So the compilers version might be better for PMEM, so I might have to seperate these.

    BFS is way too slow:
        std::atomic, might have to use this instead of using OMP critical

    Page Rank Results:
        I ran my version of page rank again for all graphs
    
    BFS:
        std::atmoic didn't work, but making a mutex for every element did
