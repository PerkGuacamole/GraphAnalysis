Ran tests for page rank with explicit vectorization on neighbors versus v2, where the compiler vectoizes on page rank matrix.
Seems that mine is faster for lower number of page ranks, and the compiler's version is better for higher number of page ranks.
Action:
	Use the compiler version
	Also switching from static to dynamic scheduling
