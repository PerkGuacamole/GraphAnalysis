Memory Test
    Read Linear
        Still not performing properly on the test machine
        I think I need to put a reduction clause on the sum variable
    Read Random
        PMEM latency lower than DRAM ?!?!?!?
        I need to look into this more
    Write Linear/Random
        Significantly slower than DRAM, this was expected

Graph Tests
    BFS
        Might need to get other graphs, disconnected graphs really mess up the results
    Page Rank
        This seems fine, PMEM is at half performance of DRAM.
        If latency is truely lower, than why would page rank be slower on PMEM?
        Page rank is a read heavy operation, with some writes to a vector.
        There really isn't that much overhead.
        The vector is the same for both PMEM and DRAM, which means the only difference is the type of memory for the graph.
        The only way to reason this is that PMEM read bandwidth is much slower than DRAM read bandwidth.

Next Steps:
	Maybe ask to update G++ on the test machine, its version is 7.5, which doesn't have C++17 support (this isn't super important)
    Fix the Read Linear test
    Find some more large graphs to use (trying to find connected graphs for bfs runs)
    Start doing the transactions for guarunteed persistence (should make performance even worse for writes)
